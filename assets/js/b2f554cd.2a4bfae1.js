You will be able to decide when you want to upgrade, especially if you are updating containers automatically.\\n- Backup your `database.sqlite`. You can find it in the configuration directory, by default:\\n    - on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.komga/database.sqlite`\\n    - on Unix: `~/.komga/database.sqlite`\\n    - on Docker: in the directory you mounted as `/config`\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\n- The minimum Java version required will be Java 17:\\n    - If you run Komga using the `jar`, you will need to make sure your Java version is sufficient by running `java -version`.\\n    - If you run Komga using Docker, you don\'t need to do anything.\\n- The hashing algorithm for files and pages will change. Previous hashes for files and pages will be deleted. On startup, if hashing is enabled, Komga will re-hash files and pages using the new algorithm.\\n- The default port will be changed from `8080` to `25600`:\\n    - If you use Docker, you will need to update your container or compose configuration to expose the new port.\\n    - You may need to adjust your reverse proxy settings.\\n    - You can still change the port [through configuration](/docs/installation/configuration#server_port--serverport-port)."}]}')}}]);
