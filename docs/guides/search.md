# Full Text Search

Komga leverages [Full Text Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search) (FTS hereafter) to provide relevant results from your libraries.

- FTS will order results by relevance
- FTS is case-insensitive
- When searching with CJK characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), a minimum of 2 characters is required.
- The order of words is not important: `batman robin` will match `Robin & Batman`
- To search by words in order, enclose your search in `"`: `"white knight"` will not match `knight white` nor `white and knight`
- By default, the search will match the item title. For Books, the ISBN will also be matched by default.
- You can use the `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operators (UPPERCASE) to build complex queries:
  - `batman NOT publisher:dc` will match all `Batman` series not published by _DC Comics_
  - `batman OR robin` will match `Batman` or `Robin`
  - `batman AND (robin OR superman)` will match `Superman & Batman` and `Batman & Robin`
  - `writer:remender penciller:murphy`
- You can perform range queries using the `[a TO b]` syntax. Example: `release_date:[1990 TO 2000]`. Note that the matching is lexicographic, not numerical. You can also use wildcards: `release_date:[2010 TO *]`.

Some extra fields are available for search using the `field:search` syntax, see after.
