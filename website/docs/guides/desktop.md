# Desktop Application

The Desktop application runs in your menu bar / tray icon:

<img src="/assets/media/guides/desktop/desktop-menu.png" style={{maxHeight: '200px'}} alt="Desktop application menu"/>

From the menu you can:
- Open Komga: this will open the [web interface](./webui).
- Show log file: this will open a file explorer at the location of the log file.
- Open configuration directory: this will open a file explorer at the location of the configuration directory.
- Quit Komga: this will stop Komga and exit the application.
